# Flow Free
Flow Free is a simple, free to play puzzle game. Enjoy. 

#### How To Play:
A level of flow consists of a grid of squares with certain squares containing colored
circles. The objective of the game is to draw a path connecting each circle to its
corresponding colored one. Drawing a path will create a visible line. However, no lines
of differing color may intersect. Additionally, every square in the grid must be touched
once. Completion of a level will have multiple paths connecting each pair of circles with
no overlap. A path can be drawn by clicking down with the mouse and dragging. 

#### Set up: 
Clone the project then run the flow-app executable. No code or files needs to be modified.
