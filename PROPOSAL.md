# Final Project

##### My idea:
My project idea is to create the game flow free. Most people 
have played this game before, and it can be surprisingly engaging 
for some reason. I've played this game for countless hours and I 
feel like it would be a fun project to make. The idea came to me 
when I was talking to my friend and he was talking about how he 
might consider buying a level pack for Flow Free because he's beat 
all the free levels. Jokingly, I said, "Don't worry I'll  just make 
some levels for you." Seconds later, I realized that that was actually 
a pretty good idea. My idea is to utilize Cinder and create a grid
where the user can draw paths and connect the colored blocks.

##### Why I think it's doable:
The past two labs have given me plenty exposure on using Cinder. I feel
comfortable creating a displayable grid. Then, I just have to learn how to
draw and determine when a path from color to color has been created. 

## Timeline: 
##### Week 1:
- [x] Set up the project structure and classes necessary (Similar to the 
bowling scorecard assignment).
- [x] Write the txt file containing each individual level which will be
represented by a n x n grid of characters.
- [x] Create a level class that will store the level.
- [x] Overload the >> operator to read the text file.
- [x] Create a Cinder app and display a level.

##### Week 2:
- [x] Add the ability to draw on the sketchpad.
- [x] Have the brush automatically change colors depending on where you start.
- [x] Make the sketchpad instantly clear a path that is disconnected by
a new path.
- [ ] Instantly load a new level on level completion.

##### Week 3: 
- [x] Create a level select screen.
- [x] Create a main menu screen.
- [x] Add a # of turns and a perfect score functionality.
- [x] Track colors completed and number of squares shaded.
- [ ] Create special levels with obstacles.
- [ ] Animations where necessary

##### Some extra goals:
- [ ] Switch from txt file to json file.
- [ ] Add some music.
- [ ] Add some flair when you finish levels.
- [ ] Add a level creator where users can make their own levels
